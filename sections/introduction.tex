\chapter{Background}
Containerization (or OS-Level Virtualization) \cite{virtualization} revolutionized the business world in 2013 with the introduction of Docker \cite{docker}.
Coupled with the high adoption rate of containerization saw the rapid adoption of container-orchestration tools (with the most popular being Kubernetes\cite{k8s}).

In parallel to the adoption of the aforementioned technologies, cloud-computing providers matured from offering basic compute, storage,
and networking offerings; to more managed "cloud-native" services.Amazon Web Services (AWS),
for example announced an early version of their custom container-orchestration tool (ECS) in 2015 \cite{ecs},
expanding their container-orchestration offerings with a serverless container platform (Fargate) in 2017\cite{fargate},
and a managed Kubernetes Engine (EKS) in 2018 \cite{eks}.
More recently, AWS has announced the ability to run containers as Lambdas (Serverless Functions) in late 2020\cite{lambda}.

\noindent These shifts in technological maturity enables workloads to fully leverage the advantages of containerization, with those offered by the cloud.
Unfortunately, the partition between the cloud offered container platforms are not entirely clear and rather fuzzy
(this includes performance, security, efficiency, latency and cost).\\

\noindent This Masters thesis project was conducted at Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University.
The project was undertaken in partnership with Allan Gray[\ref{sec:allan_gray}].

\section{Allan Gray}
\label{sec:allan_gray}
Allan Gray\cite{allan_gray} is a Africa's largest privately-owned and independent investment management company, with a primary focus on unit trusts.
Allan Gray hosts over 1200 employees, spread over four cities in South Africa. From these 1200, approximately 10\% are found within the I.T space,
and within the IT space at least 90\% are considered to be within a developer role.

\noindent Allan Gray is no exception to the aformentioned scenario. Allan Gray has been running container workloads in production for over five years,
running on the Kubernetes platform, on an on-premise data-center on virtual Linux machines.
Allan Gray is currently undertaking a cloud-migration, and is looking to shift their container-workloads to the cloud (with AWS being their chosen cloud platform).

\chapter{Goal}
\noindent The \textbf{goal} of this project is to investigate and compare cloud container orchestration platforms, in terms of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ease of adoption and configuration
  \item deployment process
  \item restrictions and limitations
  \item performance
  \item cost impacts
  \item reliability and resilience
  \item security
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Process}
\noindent To achieve this goal, an investigation of current designs, architecture, features, limitations, and tooling; made available by AWS in relation
to running container platforms in an industry standard manner.
In addition, a specific investigation was performed internally to Allan Gray. This investigation into existing architecture and tooling was done to ensure
that any proposed solutions meets the requirements as defined by Allan Gray.

\section{Description of Tasks}
This project was split into three major tasks:
\subsection{Research}
This task focused on
\begin{itemize}
  \item investigating industry best practices/current recommendations according to research
  \item understanding \textit{Allan Gray}'s requirements and current processes
  \item understanding the current metrics being exposed (and tooling)
  \item identifying designs/architectures which meet the requirements of this project
  \item fully documenting and understanding the various solutions available
  \item ensure that security best-practices are being followed (both in terms of system security and privacy)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Experimentation}
This task focused on defining and measuring the differences between each viable option under the metrics of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item cost
  \item performance and latency
  \item resilience and reliability
  \item ease-of-use
\end{itemize}.
% TODO - might need to remove this 
\subsection{Design and Implementation}
This task focused on using the results of the above research and experimentation to design, implement and test a solution at Allan Gray.

\section{Methods}
% TODO - might need to remove this 
A literature review was completed in order to identify current industry best practices, designs, architectures, implementations, and
pitfalls of the various cloud-orchestrations platforms options available .
In addition, interviews with members of the \textit{Allan Gray} team were conducted to get a better understanding of the current processes and limitations.
These interviews helped to identify key-metrics and requirements which are important to \textit{Allan Gray}. \\

\noindent A \textit{quantitative} analysis will be presented, using the results from the experimentation phase.
However a \textit{qualitative} analysis will also be presented, with data gathered via interviews of developers, to better understand their requirements of a solution.

\chapter{Delimitations}
This project is restricted to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item migrating container workloads (not other services/workloads) to a cloud manager provider
  \item the Amazon Web Services Cloud provider
\end{itemize}

\section{Justifying the choice of focusing solely on AWS}
Whilst it seems that experimenting only on AWS severely restricts the generality of this investigation, in reality the offerings by the other two major cloud providers
(being Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure Cloud respectively), match the Cloud Orchestrated Container offerings by AWS at a feature-parity level \cite{contaier_workloads}.
Additionally, AWS holds more that 33\% of the cloud market (as of Q4 2021) \cite{aws_cloud_share},
and is considered to be the cloud-provider of choice for the the largest tech companies in the world today \cite{aws_users}.

Therefore the results of this investigation (and recommendations) would (in theory) apply to the GCP and Azure cloud as well.
