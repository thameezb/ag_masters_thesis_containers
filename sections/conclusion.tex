\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Performance and Latency}
\subsection{CPU}
Table TODO-addRef illustrates a clear distinction in performance between the ECS and EKS solutions. with the EKS solutions providing closer performance to our baseline.
Additionally we see that the serverless solutions (those which run on Fargate) under-perform when compared to the EC2 counter-parts even when utilizing the same platform.

Table TODO-addRef further illustrates that EKS performs measurably better than ECS when running the 7-zip CPU intensive benchmark.
Furthermore Fargate workloads once again lags behind the EC2 workloads


\section{Ease-of-Use}

\section{Cost}
