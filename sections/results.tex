\part{Results and Evaluation}

This chapter presents the relevant results of the investigation and experimentation phases.
Presenting the tested cloud container orchestration platforms first,
followed by the results per experimentation requirement.

\chapter{Results}

\section{Viable Solutions}
The following platforms were evaluated as potential solutions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item AWS Lambda (representing \textit{Serverless Functions})
  \item AWS ECS
        \begin{itemize}
          \item running on EC2 (representing Virtual Machines)
          \item running on Fargate (representing Serverless Containers)
        \end{itemize}
  \item AWS EKS
        \begin{itemize}
          \item running on EC2 (representing Virtual Machines)
          \item running on Fargate (representing Serverless Containers)
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
