\part{Results and Evaluation}

This chapter presents the relevant results of the investigation and experimentation phases.
Presenting the tested cloud container orchestration platforms first,
followed by the results per metric requirement thereafter.

\chapter{Results}

\section{Viable Solutions}
The following platforms were evaluated as potential solutions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item AWS Lambda (representing \textit{Serverless Functions})
  \item AWS ECS (representing \textit{Cloud Native})
        \begin{itemize}
          \item running on EC2 (representing \textit{Virtual Machines})
          \item running on Fargate (representing \textit{Serverless Containers})
        \end{itemize}
  \item AWS EKS (representing \textit{Kubernetes})
        \begin{itemize}
          \item running on EC2 (representing \textit{Virtual Machines})
          \item running on Fargate (representing \textit{Serverless Containers})
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
