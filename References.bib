  abstract = {Server virtualization is a technological innovation broadly used in IT enterprises. Virtualization provides a platform to run different services of operating systems on the cloud. It facilitates to build multiple virtual machines on a single basic physical machine either in the form of hypervisors or containers. To host many microservice applications, the emergent technology has introduced a model which consists of different operations performed by smaller individual deployed services. Thus, the demand for low-overhead virtualization technique is rapidly developing. There are many lightweight virtualization technologies; docker is one among them, which is an open-source platform. This technology allows developers and system admins to build, create, and run applications using docker engine. This paper provides the performance evaluation of Docker containers and virtual machines using standard benchmark tools such as Sysbench, Phoronix, and Apache benchmark, which include CPU performance, Memory throughput, Storage read/write performance, load test, and operation speed measurement.}
